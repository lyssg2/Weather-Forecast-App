# Weather-Forecast-App

The purpose of this project was to make a website where a user is given a weather dashboard where they can search cities for current weather and a 5 day forecast given the OpenWeather API. Their searches are kept in a local storage so that they can easily toggle back and forth from cities.

## Description

Using the OpenWeatherAPI, the user must type in the input field the name of the city to view weather conditions. When they either press the subit button or press 'enter', they are presented with the current weather conditions of said city, as well as a 5-day forecast. Their current search is then saved in local storage, as well as presented in the sidebar as a button to be used for future use if they would like to go back to that city's weather if desired. To search a new city, the user can repeat the step above by typing in the new city name and the weather will be presented again, as well as on the sidebar. The user can then remove the past searches by clicking the clear history button.
